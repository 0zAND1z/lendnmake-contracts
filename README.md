# lendnmake-contracts

This project was done as part of ETHINDIA Hakathon and was able to get the third prize in Sponshership track by Dharma Protocol.

LendnMake is a market making application used by borrowers holding interesting collectibles in the ERC-721 format. Lenders bid on the principal willing to pay with a prefixed time of loan expiry.

If borrower paid back in full, the collateralized ERC-721 token is reverted back, else transferred to the lender!

**Why Project Lend-n-Make:**  

- More than 700,000+ digital collectibles listed are illiquid and there are no robust platform to lend.
- No lending platform for erc -721 digital assets which lends stable coin.
- Unsuitable interest rate for Lending.
- Recovery of erc-721  assets is challenging.

**Our current challenges:**  

- Delegate calls
- Setting up the dharma relayer
- Screens! No UX partner in team :/

**PS:** This is still WIP as there is too much engg. involved! Hope to see this on mainnet soon!!
